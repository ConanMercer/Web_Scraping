    "The following code block loads these packages and imports BeautifulSoup as soup, which means that we can use \"soup\" when calling BeautifulSoup functions instead of \"BeautifulSoup\" to simplify the code somewhat. Also, urllib as \"uReq\" because the code is only importing the request module. Next, re is imported to facilitate simple usages of regular expressions, very useful for defining search patterns that will be used on the data scraped from the web. Lastly, Pandas as pd providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python:"
